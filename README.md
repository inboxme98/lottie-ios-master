# lottie-ios-master



Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders the vector animations natively on mobile and through React Native!

For the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand.
Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!
Animations can be played, resized, looped, sped up, slowed down, and even interactively scrubbed.

Lottie also supports native UIViewController Transitions out of the box!
